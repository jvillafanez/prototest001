### Identities

Identities Represents an identity used to sign in to a user account.
An identity can be provided by oCIS, by organizations, or by social identity providers such as Facebook, Google, or Microsoft, that are tied to a user account.
This enables the user to sign in to the user account with any of those associated identities.
They are also used to keep a history of old usernames.

| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| sign_in_type | [string](#string) |  | Specifies the user sign-in types in your directory, such as `emailAddress`, `userName` or `federated`. Here, federated represents a unique identifier for a user from an issuer, that can be in any format chosen by the issuer. Additional validation is enforced on *issuer_assigned_id* when the sign-in type is set to `emailAddress` or `userName`. This property can also be set to any custom string. |
| issuer | [string](#string) |  | Specifies the issuer of the identity, for example facebook.com. For local accounts (where signInType is not federated), this property is the local B2C tenant default domain name, for example contoso.onmicrosoft.com. For external users from other Azure AD organization, this will be the domain of the federated organization, for example contoso.com. Supports $filter. 512 character limit. |
| issuer_assigned_id | [string](#string) |  | Specifies the unique identifier assigned to the user by the issuer. The combination of *issuer* and *issuerAssignedId* must be unique within the organization. Represents the sign-in name for the user, when signInType is set to emailAddress or userName (also known as local accounts). When *signInType* is set to: * `emailAddress`, (or starts with `emailAddress` like `emailAddress1`) *issuerAssignedId* must be a valid email address * `userName`, issuer_assigned_id must be a valid local part of an email address Supports $filter. 512 character limit. |

### OnPremisesProvisioningError



| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| category | [string](#string) |  | Category of the provisioning error. Note: Currently, there is only one possible value. Possible value: PropertyConflict - indicates a property value is not unique. Other objects contain the same value for the property. |
| occurred_date_time | [google.protobuf.Timestamp](#googleprotobuftimestamp) |  | The date and time at which the error occurred. |
| property_causing_error | [string](#string) |  | Name of the directory property causing the error. Current possible values: UserPrincipalName or ProxyAddress |
| value | [string](#string) |  | Value of the property causing the error. |

### PasswordProfile



| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| password | [string](#string) |  | The password for the user. This property is required when a user is created. It can be updated, but the user will be required to change the password on the next login. The password must satisfy minimum requirements as specified by the user’s passwordPolicies property. By default, a strong password is required. |
| last_password_change_date_time | [google.protobuf.Timestamp](#googleprotobuftimestamp) |  | The time when this account last changed their password. |
| password_policies | [string](#string) | repeated | Specifies password policies for the user. This value is an enumeration with one possible value being “DisableStrongPassword”, which allows weaker passwords than the default policy to be specified. “DisablePasswordExpiration” can also be specified. |
| force_change_password_next_sign_in | [bool](#bool) |  | true* if the user must change her password on the next login; otherwise false. |
| force_change_password_next_sign_in_with_mfa | [bool](#bool) |  | If *true*, at next sign-in, the user must perform a multi-factor authentication (MFA) before being forced to change their password. The behavior is identical to forceChangePasswordNextSignIn except that the user is required to first perform a multi-factor authentication before password change. After a password change, this property will be automatically reset to false. If not set, default is false. |

| {{< div id="float" content="float" >}} |  | float | float |
| {{< div id="int32" content="int32" >}} | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint32 instead. | int32 | int |
| {{< div id="int64" content="int64" >}} | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint64 instead. | int64 | long |
| {{< div id="uint32" content="uint32" >}} | Uses variable-length encoding. | uint32 | int |
| {{< div id="uint64" content="uint64" >}} | Uses variable-length encoding. | uint64 | long |
| {{< div id="sint32" content="sint32" >}} | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int32s. | int32 | int |
| {{< div id="sint64" content="sint64" >}} | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int64s. | int64 | long |
| {{< div id="fixed32" content="fixed32" >}} | Always four bytes. More efficient than uint32 if values are often greater than 2^28. | uint32 | int |
| {{< div id="fixed64" content="fixed64" >}} | Always eight bytes. More efficient than uint64 if values are often greater than 2^56. | uint64 | long |
| {{< div id="sfixed32" content="sfixed32" >}} | Always four bytes. | int32 | int |
| {{< div id="sfixed64" content="sfixed64" >}} | Always eight bytes. | int64 | long |
| {{< div id="bool" content="bool" >}} |  | bool | boolean |
| {{< div id="string" content="string" >}} | A string must always contain UTF-8 encoded or 7-bit ASCII text. | string | String |
| {{< div id="bytes" content="bytes" >}} | May contain any arbitrary sequence of bytes. | string | ByteString |
